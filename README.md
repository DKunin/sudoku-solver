# Sudoku Solver Practice

[What is Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)

The exercise is twofold:
1) Create algorithm to solve any sudoku puzzle
2) Create interface for user to be able to enter example sudoku - and find a solution for it

## Participate

```shell
    git clone git@github.com:DKunin/sudoku-solver
    cd sudoku-solver
    mkdir <YOUR_USERNAME>
```

The result of your code should be:
- index.html file with the interface
- index.js with examples of usage

You can use any libraries or frameworks, except complete solutions. Add your own packages with seperate package json in your subfolder. Do not forget to add your node_modules folder to .gitignore

Make a PR.
